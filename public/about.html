<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Marco Gomez and I'm an aspiring developer. My journey into tech started back when I was 21 years old, and through the patience of my friend I had began and finished building my first PC. 
  This small act was the spark that kindled the flames of curiosity I had into the tech world. 
  Not knowing where to start I began with a job working as a Cable Technician for WOW Internet Cable and Phone, this led to roles on the support side of IT such as Help Desk and Support Specialist.
  It wasn't until I was 26 that I decided to give programming a try, at the behest of the same friend that got me into computers.
  Attempting to be self-taught proved to be much more difficult than I had anticipated and decided to try to get into some more formal education. 
  Finally at 28 I began working on my Bachelors in Software Engineering, and I've been loving everyday where I'm learning and coding.

<p>I was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina where my father was stationed with the US Army.
  Thanks to my father being in the military I've had the good fortune of becoming somewhat traveled and exposed to much of the world at a much earlier age than most of my peers.
  This led to diversifying my way of thinking from a young age, and giving me the ability to be both empathetic and understanding with my peers. 
  As an adult I believe this has given me the ability to really think outside of the box when it comes to providing solutions or troubleshooting issues.
